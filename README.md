# ZORA Frontend Exercise #1

## Instructions

In this exercise we’d like you to create an React app using the [unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) API.

In the app a user should be able to:

- Enter a search term into a search box
- View a list of images related to their search
- Know when there are no results that match their search term

You are free to use any libraries you like, alternatively you can rely on the native React and Web APIs.

We’ve already created an unsplash access key in .env you but you may want to [familiarize yourself with the search endpoint](https://unsplash.com/documentation#search-photos) or the [search method from the official SDK](https://github.com/unsplash/unsplash-js#search).

You are encouraged to think out loud, ask us for help or clarification and look up any documentation you need.

You do not need to finish the task. We are more concerned with getting an idea of your frontend knowledge, how you approach problems and what you might be like to work with.
