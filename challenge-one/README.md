# ZORA Frontend Challenge #1

In this challenge we’d like you to create an React.JS application using the unsplash API. A user should be able to:

- Enter a search term into a search box
- View a list of images related to their search
- Know when there are no results that match their search term

We’ve already created an unsplash access key in .env you but you may want to [familiarize yourself with the search endpoint](https://unsplash.com/documentation#search-photos) or the [search method from the official SDK](https://github.com/unsplash/unsplash-js#search). We’ve also bootstrapped create-react-app with TypeScript.

You are free to use any libraries you like, alternatively you can rely on the native React and Web APIs.

You are encouraged to think out loud, ask us for help or clarification and look up any documentation you need.

You’ll have 40 minutes to complete the challenge but it's perfectly fine if you don't complete all the requirements. We are less concerned with seeing you finish and more concerned with getting an understanding of your frontend knowledge, how you approach problems and what you might be like to work with.
